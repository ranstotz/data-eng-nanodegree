## SQL vs NoSQL

### Advantages of Using a Relational Database

- Flexibility for writing in SQL queries: With SQL being the most common database query language.
- Modeling the data not modeling queries
- Ability to do JOINS
- Ability to do aggregations and analytics
- Secondary Indexes available : You have the advantage of being able to add another index to help with quick searching.
- Smaller data volumes: If you have a smaller data volume (and not big data) you can use a relational database for its simplicity.
- ACID Transactions: Allows you to meet a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee validity even in the event of errors, power failures, and thus maintain data integrity.
- Easier to change to business requirements

### When Not to Use a Relational Database

- Have large amounts of data: Relational Databases are not distributed databases and because of this they can only scale vertically by adding more storage in the machine itself. You are limited by how much you can scale and how much data you can store on one machine. You cannot add more machines like you can in NoSQL databases.
- Need to be able to store different data type formats: Relational databases are not designed to handle unstructured data.
- Need high throughput -- fast reads: While ACID transactions bring benefits, they also slow down the process of reading and writing data. If you need very fast reads and writes, using a relational database may not suit your needs.
- Need a flexible schema: Flexible schema can allow for columns to be added that do not have to be used by every row, saving disk space.
- Need high availability: The fact that relational databases are not distributed (and even when they are, they have a coordinator/worker architecture), they have a single point of failure. When that database goes down, a fail-over to a backup system occurs and takes time.
- Need horizontal scalability: Horizontal scalability is the ability to add more machines or nodes to a system to increase performance and space for data.

### When to use a NoSQL Database

- Need to be able to store different data type formats: NoSQL was also created to handle different data configurations: structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. JSON, XML documents can all be handled easily with NoSQL.
- Large amounts of data: Relational Databases are not distributed databases and because of this they can only scale vertically by adding more storage in the machine itself. NoSQL databases were created to be able to be horizontally scalable. The more servers/systems you add to the database the more data that can be hosted with high availability and low latency (fast reads and writes).

### When NOT to use a NoSQL Database?

- When you have a small dataset: NoSQL databases were made for big datasets not small datasets and while it works it wasnâ€™t created for that.
- When you need ACID Transactions: If you need a consistent database with ACID transactions, then most NoSQL databases will not be able to serve this need. NoSQL database are eventually consistent and do not provide ACID transactions. However, there are exceptions to it. Some non-relational databases like MongoDB can support ACID transactions.
- When you need the ability to do JOINS across tables: NoSQL does not allow the ability to do JOINS. This is not allowed as this will result in full table scans.
- If you want to be able to do aggregations and analytics
- If you have changing business requirements : Ad-hoc queries are possible but difficult as the data model was done to fix particular queries
- If your queries are not available and you need the flexibility : You need your queries in advance. If those are not available or you will need to be able to have flexibility on how you query your data you might need to stick with a relational database
